# Game Shop

Game Shop is a mock-up of an e-commerce website that sells videogames.






## Tech Stack

Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)




## Lessons Learned


This project was a great hands-on experience building a React app with Vite and React Router

I applied custom hooks and useEffect to fetch data using React and Fetch api

This project made me comfortable using React Router.  I created a custom Router component, and utilized nested routes, outlets, and dynamic segments.

One of my favorite things I learned was how you can use an index route, which renders in the parent route's outlet at the parent route's path.  Or put simply, it allows you to have a default component rendered in an outlet when you're just at the homepage.
